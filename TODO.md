# To Do

Initial "Hello World":

1. Logging
2. Metrics
3. Github Actions (dependabot)

Once "hello world" is deployed and running in dev:

1. Structure the app properly, as per [Fast API Guidelines](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/bigger-applications/)
2. Link it to the python dev standards - example code and README
3. Tests - local, pipelines. [tox](https://tox.wiki/en/4.21.2/#)
4. Sonar config - sonar-project.properties
5. A python base image (including the self-signed cert)
